# Statamic Peak Tools

This is an addon for [Statamic Peak](https://github.com/studio1902/statamic-peak) that contains tools like the picture partial, the noscript partial, the pagination partial, the toolbar and the missing alt text widget.

Maintaining Peak demands a lot of my time and it probably saves you a lot. Your sponsoring would mean a great deal to me as it makes it much easier for me to maintain this project and keep improving it. [Sponsor me](https://github.com/sponsors/studio1902).

[Read the docs](https://peak.1902.studio).

## How to Install

This addon is automatically installed when you install Peak via the Statamic CLI. If you want to install this addon manually on an older Peak install run:

``` bash
composer require studio1902/statamic-peak-tools
```

You will have to manually remove all files installed with this addon.
